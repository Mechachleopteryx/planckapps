It does run under windows. I had to install.

Python-2.7.4
Numpy-1.7.1-win32
scipy-0.12-win32
wxpython2.8-unicode-py27
PyFits-3.1.2-win32-py
matplotlib-1.2.1-win32

Should just have to click on the cmb_widget.py script

Seems to work better under linux. Sliders tend to jump to extreme
values unless yu click accurately on them. Might be issue for touch screens.
